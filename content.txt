1. Class and Object
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    ->code walkthrough
    -> attributes get called itself,method is called manually
3. Why python is called oop? everything in python is an object
4. Advantages of oop
      -> you can create data type
      -> code reusability
      -> debugging
      -> easy to collab
5. End to End Project
      -> function vs method
      -> magic method or dundor method
      -> self keyword
      -> You can create attribute outside class as well
      -> encapsulation
      -> getter and setter
      -> static method
6. Inheritance
      -> Inheritance code example
      -> Why inheritance is needed?(code reusability,parent has no access to child class)
      -> What gets inherited? constructor, non private attributes, non private methods
      -> constructor overloading and method overloading
      -> super keyword(can be used only inside class , can not access variables/attributes,used only inside child class)
      -> Types of inheritance - 1. Single inheritance | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchial | 4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> | 5. Hybrid
