    -> attributes get called itself,method is called manually
3. Why python is called oop? everything in python is an object
4. Advantages of oop
      -> you can create data type
      -> code reusability
      -> debugging
      -> easy to collab
5. End to End Project
      -> function vs method
      -> magic method or dundor method
      -> self keyword
      -> You can create attribute outside class as well
      -> encapsulation
      -> getter and setter
      -> static method
